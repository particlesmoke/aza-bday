I was reading the mail I had sent you way back about the school I wanna build... And I hadn't really incorporated you into the vision at that time... But then I thought over it, and matlab you come into it beautifully, like har chhote chhote aspect mei jobhi maine describe kar rakha hai... Will write in detail about it later... And then I read the blog in which I have described the grounds and the exterior of that school and realised ki in the two year gap between those two writeups, the basic vision hasn't changed much. It's still about providing a full fledged learning environment for students, jisme har detail par dhyaan diya gaya ho... So that while being homely and comfortable, it's still highly sophisticated and professional, like I have pointed plans for everything from the dorms, to the time tables, to the classrooms to the canteens, everything. And it's still about forming real connections with students and maintaining a structure around it, so it's not just a one off event ki a teacher has a good bond with their students, but an effect of the system put in place. And Rimjhim, now that I have thought about it, I so want you to be a part of this. </p> </div>

Don't be hard on yourself, and enjoy the many lil good things that present themselves everyday (like all the more food storage you gonna get) üòÅ. Make some moments only for yourself, just you, no worries in the world. I love you.</p>
