I'll work on adding historical view so if you miss any day's update or wanna look at something again, you can... <br> Par please dekh liya kar na... <br> I couldn't express earlier about how grateful I am for being an audience to your thoughts. So that only. I am really happy that a thoughtful person like you is in my life. Matlab, it really affects the mind a lot, the kindof person you talk with the most, like if I talk to dumb people I'll get dumber because my subconscious will adjust to that, I try to stay particularly vigilant about this. Talking with you makes me better, makes me not forget to be thoughful and think crazy and interesting things, and I am thankful to you for that <br> I was thinking about your kisses, not that I have any experience, but yours gotta be the best ones in the world, yaad karke hi I can feel good : ) what of really getting one. (I am talking of cheek ones btw, all others, mine are better)</p>

If I am ever able to draw like him, I'll buy a lil notebook for us, and I'll draw all our adventures together on it. And you could add embellishments or notes on it üòÅ <br> (click on the image to view more)</p>
