                                A person who thinks all the time <br>
                                Has nothing to think about except thoughts <br>
                                So, he loses touch with reality <br>
                                And lives in a world of illusions <br>
                                By thoughts I mean specifically, chatter in the skull <br>
                                Perpetual and compulsive repetition of words <br>
                                Of reckoning and calculating <br>
                                I'm not saying that thinking is bad <br>
                                Like everything else, It's useful in moderation <br>
                                A good servant, but a bad master <br>
                                And all so called civilized peoples <br>
                                Have increasingly become crazy and self destructive <br>
                                Because, through excessive thinking <br>
                                The have lost touch with reality <br>
                                That's to say <br>
                                We confuse signs <br>
                                With the real world <br>
                                This is the beginning of meditation <br>
                                Most of us would have <br>
                                Rather money than tangible wealth <br>
                                And a great occasion is somehow spoiled for us unless photographed <br>
                                And to read about it the next day in the newspaper <br>
                                Is oddly more fun for us than the original event <br>
                                This is a disaster <br>
                                For as a result of confusing the real world of nature with mere signs <br>
                                We are destroying nature <br>
                                We are so tied up in our minds that we've lost our senses <br>
                                Time to wake up <br>
                                What is reality? <br>
                                Obviously no one can say <br>
                                Because it isn't words <br>
                                It isn't material, that's just an idea <br>
                                Reality is <br>
                                The point cannot be explained in words <br>
                                I'm not trying to put you down <br>
                                It's an expression of you as you are <br>
                                One must live <br>
                                We need to survive, to go on <br>
                                We must go on <br>

                        <p>This is actually a speech by Alan Watts, and it makes a lot of sense. And I was thinking how my love for you is not just in my thoughts, which I am able to put in words, and symbols, and the fairly superficial things I make for you, but it is my reality bilkul.</p>
                        <p>I started off by trying to make a wave (depicting emotion) through the heart, ye ban gaya.</p>
                        <p>This is also an advice, to get out of our thoughts and really feel the real world sometimes, no words, no symbols, just what exists.</p>
